Lando recipes in shell script

## What is Lando?
[Lando](https://lando.dev/) It's a free, open source, cross-platform, local development environment and DevOps tool built on Docker container technology and developed by Tandem.

Besides a dedicated CLI, your can build a full development environment with a recipe (.sh file), making you ready to build your Laravel, Drupal, Wordpress, LAMP and so many other type of project.

## Who it works?
- Lando as an abstraction layer to Docker containers, you can setup the services and tooling needed to develop your project;
- Automate complex build steps, testing setups, deployments or other repeated-more-than-once workflow;
- Avoid the built-in-masochism of directly using docker or docker-compose;
- Ship these local development dependencies in a per-project, lives-in-git config file.

## Where I start
[Lando docs are well written](https://docs.lando.dev/basics/)
